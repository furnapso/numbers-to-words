# Numbers to words
## About The Project
This project is a web application that converts numerical input into its corresponding word representation. For example, the input 123.45 will be converted to ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY-FIVE CENTS. The application consists of a React frontend for user interaction and a Java Spring backend that performs the conversion.
